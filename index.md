### A bit more about me

I am well versed in C++, and I have a deep understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have created multiple 
applications using one or a combination of those languages. 

I am excited about opportunities that allow me to build upon my knowledge and skills as a programmer and designer.
