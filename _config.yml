  I am majoring in Information Systems and minoring in Computer Science at Seattle Pacific University with an expected graduation date in June 2021.<br>
  I am well versed in C++, and I have a deep understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have created multiple applications using one <br>
  or a combination of those languages. I have affinities for collaborative problem-solving and could be described as a curious, self-starter. <br>
