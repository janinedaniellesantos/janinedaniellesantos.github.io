## GrapeVine (Mobile Application)

**Challenge**
InternHacks is a program that combines the hackathon and tech internship experience. We were asked to to create an application in 6 weeks (web or mobile).

 **Solution**
Our cross-functional team created GrapeVine, a mobile application that matches the users' ethical values with businesses to support and content to interact with.
As the designer and project manager of the team I researched user persona and fully designed a mobile app while following a sprint plan.
